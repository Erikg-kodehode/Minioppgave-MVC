# MVC Project

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in C#. 

## Project Structure

- **src/**
  - **Controller.cs**: Contains the `Controller` class that manages the interaction between the `Model` and `View`.
  - **Model.cs**: Contains the `Model` class that holds arbitrary data and provides methods to manipulate it.
  - **View.cs**: Contains the `View` class responsible for displaying the data from the `Model`.

- **Program.cs**: The entry point of the application, where instances of `Model`, `View`, and `Controller` are created and interactions are set up.

- **mvc-project.csproj**: The project configuration file for .NET, specifying dependencies and settings.

## Getting Started

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using the .NET CLI:
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

## Overview of MVC Architecture

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It notifies the `View` of any changes to the data.
  
- **View**: Displays the data from the `Model` and sends user commands to the `Controller`.
  
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between `Model` and `View`. It updates the `Model` based on user input and refreshes the `View` accordingly.

This project serves as a basic example of how to implement the MVC pattern in a C# application.
